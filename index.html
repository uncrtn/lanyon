# Hi, I’m Paul

I write online. I have been a passive spectator online for a long time. Recently, I decided to make things for the web instead of just consuming media.

Since you’re reading this, you should consider making something online yourself. For writing, I suggest [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) but there are lots of other options out there. When considering where to write, I highly encourage you to write at a place where you retain all rights to your work. You can always repost on Twitter, Facebook, etc, but the origin point of your work should remain under your control.

This blog is a place to keep track of whatever I end up making. I don’t have a set plan on what I will make but there is much to learn. Along the way, I will link to interesting reads and resources I find.
