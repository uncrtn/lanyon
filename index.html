<h1>Hi, I’m Paul</h1>

<p>I write online. I have been a passive spectator online for a long time. Recently, I decided to make things for the web instead of just consuming media.</p>

<p>Since you’re reading this, you should consider making something online yourself. For writing, I suggest <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> but there are lots of other options out there. When considering where to write, I highly encourage you to write at a place where you retain all rights to your work. You can always repost on Twitter, Facebook, etc, but the origin point of your work should remain under your control.</p>

<p>This blog is a place to keep track of whatever I end up making. I don’t have a set plan on what I will make but there is much to learn. Along the way, I will link to interesting reads and resources I find. </p>
