I was browsing some Micro.blog pages when I came across the [2018 Running Challenge](https://burk.io/running/) page from [@burk](https://micro.blog/Burk). I hope he doesn’t mind me borrowing his idea and adapting it for myself. 

It’s been a while since I have been running on a consistent basis so I thought it best to track overall steps for each week. And, since I am starting late in the year, I am going to break the year up into three segments. I will keep track of fall, spring, and summer as if I was going back to school. I find that I work better with short term goals so breaking it up this way should help. 

## Fall 2018
I have challenged myself to do a minimum of 7,500 steps per day or 52,500 steps per week. By the end of the year I should have 892,500 steps. 

One reason to keep track of steps instead of miles is that the numbers look huge. It looks like a massive accomplishment to have walked close to one million steps in four months. 

I am also taking advantage of the fact that I racked up lots of steps at the start of September while abroad.
